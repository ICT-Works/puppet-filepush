This is the filepush module.

This module was created simply to push files. It is fully parameterized to use with Foreman 1.1  I wanted to be able to fill in parameters on the web interface.

Example
-------
class ct-filepush (
  $source = undef,
  $target = undef,
  $owner  = undef,
  $group  = $owner,
  $mode   = 0644,
) {
  case $::osfamily {
    'Windows': { fail('Does not yet work wint Windows') }
    default: {
      $path_sep = '/'
      $filepath_ar = split($target, $path_sep)
      $parent_path = join(delete_at($filepath_ar, -1), $path_sep)
      exec { 'make_parent_dirs':
        path    => [ '/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin', '/bin'],
        command => "mkdir -p ${parent_path}",
        unless  => "test -d ${parent_path}"
      }
    }
  }

  file { $target:
    ensure => directory,
    path   => $target,
    mode   => $mode,
    owner  => $owner,
    group  => $group,
    source => $source,
  }
}

This is so I can push a file to a directory and if parent directories do not exist create them.  This gives you a blank template to just pop values in and apply.

TODO
----

- Need to make it compatible with windows.  If anyone knows how to mkdir -p in windows let me know and I will finish adding this.
